\section{Outline}
\label{sec:outline}

  \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{asset/flowchart.png}
    \caption{A simple example of outline.}
    \label{fig:flowchart}
  \end{figure}

  \xfig{fig:flowchart} shows the skelton of the whole system. The left-top 
  part is the scrawled database, which defines ``what'' is in the database. 
  As shown, the database contains necessary medical information of patients. 
  The right-top part is the situation that a patient has maken an appointment 
  with doctor and he need to take a physical examination first. By insert the 
  ID card, the physical data will be recorded into the local database, syncing 
  with the central database, and in the mean time, the result of examination 
  will be sended to ``auto-detecters'', which detect the abnormal data in the 
  physical reports, and notify the patient. The auto-detecters can detect 
  potential diseases like cancer by determining the gene expression profiling, 
  or diabetes by the physical data. 
  The middle part is the situation that a patient or a doctor wants to obtain 
  the information of the patient. After inserting the ID card, the local 
  database will check whether the status of corresponding data. If it is out of 
  date or not exists, the local database will try to sync with the central 
  database, otherwise create a new one if this patient is totally new. Eventually, 
  the information of this patient is returned to the client (device). 
  The bottom part shows a doctor make the diagnosis and prescription for the 
  patient. The new diagnosis and prescription are write-backed to the local 
  database, and also sync with the central one. 

\section{Features}
\label{sec:features}

  With this E-healthcare management system, the hospital/clinic can easily 
  sync the information of patients with other health systems, manage 
  the information of patients.
  For patients, the patient can do most of the things online, for example, 
  make a doctor appointment, look up the medical records and prescriptions, 
  and obtain the physical reports at home. Even more, the system use machine 
  learning to detect the abnormal data in the reports, notify the patient 
  to prevent the disease becoming worse. 
  To conclusion, the major features of the system can be summarized as 
  followings: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Automatically sync the information of patients between different health systems by using local and central database. 
    \item Facilitate the accessing of medical records and prescriptions, for both doctors and patients. 
    \item Introduce the automatic disease detecters by leveraging machine learning and big data. 
  \end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
  \subsection*{Database}
  \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.6]{asset/database/DB_UML.png}
    \caption{The UML of the whole database.}
    \label{fig:DB_UML}
  \end{figure}
  \xfig{fig:DB_UML} shows the UML of the database. It can be divided into four 
  parts, the class definition of patients' information, the database API, the 
  class definition of database, and the database factory. 

  \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.35]{asset/database/pinfo.png}
    \caption{The UML of the class definition of patient information.}
    \label{fig:pinfo_UML}
  \end{figure}
  \xfig{fig:pinfo_UML} shows the class definition of the patients' information. 
  The class, \codeword{patient\_info\_t}, contains the necessary information of 
  a patient, for example, UID, name, birth date, and the list of medical records. 
  And in the class, \codeword{med\_record\_t}, is date and reports, like diagnosis, 
  prescriptions, and physical data and reports. 
  In this part, it provides a definition of patients' information for the whole 
  database. Later, the database will depend on the class defined in this part. 

  \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{asset/database/DB_API.png}
    \caption{The UML of the class definition of database API.}
    \label{fig:API_UML}
  \end{figure}
  \xfig{fig:API_UML} is the definition of the API of the database. It provide 
  some simple and secure methods to access the database, for example, load the 
  information of a patient, update the information, and set the database. 
  Later, those parts of the system that need to access the database rely on 
  this API. 

  \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{asset/database/database_instance.png}
    \caption{The UML of the class definition of database instance.}
    \label{fig:DB_instance}
  \end{figure}
  Here is the definition of the databases. First is an interface of the 
  database, it defines some common methods of database, like connect, require, 
  update, and sync with other database. 
  Then are the specialized databases. Here, plain text database, SQLs are defined. 

  The rationales behind the need of an interface is, in the early development, 
  we did not determine which type of database should be use. And second, when 
  scaling the system up, the database may need to be replaced with other databases 
  that have higher throughput and lower response time, like ScyllaDB. 
  An interface of the database solves the problems, because it abstracts the 
  database and unify the methods. The additional databases can be easily provided 
  by following the interface. 

  \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.7]{asset/database/factory_UML.png}
    \caption{The UML of the factory of databases.}
    \label{fig:factory_UML}
  \end{figure}

  \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{asset/database/simple_factory.png}
    \caption{The UML of a simple factory.}
    \label{fig:simple_factory}
  \end{figure}
  Then is the factory of database, which shown in \xfig{fig:factory_UML}. 
  In short, factory is responsible for instantiating the database. And it is actually 
  a pattern from $\textit{Design Patterns}$. 
  The general UML of factory pattern is shown in \xfig{fig:simple_factory}. The 
  products inherit a common interface, and they are all instantiated by the factory. 
  The advantage of factory patterns is it hides the details of ``creation'', which 
  allows the factory changing the implementation without modifying the usage of the 
  creation. It is a very import characteristics in developing a big system. The 
  modification of the usage of methods can cost lots of time and effort, because 
  all the programs that use the methods should be modified. 
  
  To conclusion, this design of database has the following features:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Hide the detail of the creation. 
    \item An uniform application interface. 
    \item High Scalability. 
    \item Easy to maintain. 
  \end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this project, we develope a E-healthcare management system, which solves 
the syncing problem between different health systems by using local and 
central database, and facilitate most of the services by transfer them into 
internet. Even more, we introduce the automatic disease detecters, which 
is able to detect multiple diseases by leveraging the machine learning 
techniques. 

In technological aspect, we use object-oriented programming to shorten the 
development time, and modularize the whole system into several parts, like 
database, frontend, medium, and detecter (processor). With that, the system 
is highly scalable and easy to maintain.
